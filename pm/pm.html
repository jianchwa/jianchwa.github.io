wake up the userland process with signal or wake up the kthread directly.<br/>
How does the task to be frozen know it should enter into frozen state ?<br/>
The answer is the interface : try_to_freeze()<br/>

It is hooked into get_signal() thus the userland tasks could detect the
freezing. And every developer of kernel thread should add try_to_freeze() into
its kthread body to detect the freezing request of pm system.<br/>
<pre>
try_to_free()
    -> try_to_freeze_unsafe()
        -> __refrigerator() // if freezing(current)

            set_current_state(TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE);

            spin_lock_irq(&freezer_lock);
            current->flags |= PF_FROZEN;
            if (!freezing(current) ||
                 (check_kthr_stop && kthread_should_stop()))
                current->flags &= ~PF_FROZEN;

            schedule();
>>>>
</pre>
The task need to <font color="red">set flag PF_FROZEN self</font> and invoke schedule() to go to frozen state.

The freezing() interface will check whether the task should enter into frozen state.<br/>
<pre>
static inline bool freezing(struct task_struct *p)
{
	if (likely(!atomic_read(&system_freezing_cnt)))
		return false;
	/*
	   This global variable is increased in freeze_processes()
	 */
	return freezing_slow_path(p);
}
</pre>
frozen() is to check whether a task has been frozon, in the other word, the PF_FROZEN has been set. 

We have seen how does freeze_task() wakeup the tasks, no mater userland or
kernel ones. It cannot handle the tasks that in TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE state.
These tasks may be waiting for I/O or locks. <br/> 

try_to_freeze_tasks() will loop and wait until all the tasks enter into frozen state or
the freezing procedure has lasted for freeze_timeout_msecs (20s). 
<pre>
In theory, 20s is long enough to complete I/O or get a lock, otherwise, there maybe IO hang or deadlock occurring.
</pre>
Then it will invoke sched_show_task() to show the state of tasks cannot be frozen. try_to_freeze_tasks() will return -EBUSY then the suspend procedure will be stopped and fail.<br/>

<font size="2">
It is essential that neither filesystem state nor metadata changes during system suspend. This is why SCSI devices are quiesced. The SCSI core quiesces devices through scsi_device_quiesce() and scsi_device_resume(). In the SDEV_QUIESCE state execution of non-preempt requests is deferred. This is realized by returning BLKPREP_DEFER from inside scsi_prep_state_check() for quiesced SCSI devices.<br/>
In the past, scsi_device_quiesce() will invoke scsi_run_queue() until sdev->device_busy drops to zero to drain all the outstanding requests. Because the device has been quiesced, no requests could enter into scsi driver, but only stay in blk-mq layer. There is a big defect here, even though the requests stay in blk-mq layer and will not enter into scsi driver, but they actually have occupied tags even used up the tags. This will prevent PM management requests to be submitted and finally IO hangs.<br/>

So 3a0a529( block, scsi: Make SCSI quiesce and resume work reliably) was introduced to fix this issue through defferring allocation of non-preempt requests. Let's go to look at how to achieve that.
<pre>

     * for percpu_ref_tryget() callers that occur after the queue

        sdev->quiesced_by = current;
    else
        blk_clear_preempt_only(q);

First, need to emphasize, NVMe doesn't have this kind issue, it have seperated queues for admin and IO requests.<br/>
On the other hand, this patch change the quiesced state of scsi device a lot, it actually <font color="red">'freezes'</font> the request queue.
In the past, new IO cannot enter into scsi driver, but can enter into blk-mq layer. Now, IO submitter will be blocked on generic_make_request(), this looks like the request queue has been frozen.
