<h3><a name="Lock_Resource">Lock Resource</a></h3>
<p>
<font size="2">
<pre>
A lock resource has the following components:
<ul>
<li> A name, which is a string of no more than 31 characters
<li> A lock value block
<li> A set of lock queues
</ul>
Lock Resource Queues
<ul>
<li> Grant Queue
<pre>
     The grant queue contains all locks granted by the lock manager on the lock resource, except those locks
     converting to a mode incompatible with the mode of a granted lock.
</pre>
<li> Convert Queue
<pre>
    The convert queue contains all <U>granted</U> locks that have attempted to convert to a mode <U>incompatible</U> with the
    mode of the most restrictive currently granted lock. The locks on the convert queue are still granted at the same
    mode as before the conversion request. The lock manager processes the locks on the convert queue in "first-in,
    first-out" (FIFO) order.
</pre>
<li> Wait Queue
<pre>
    The wait queue contains all new lock requests not yet granted because their mode is incompatible with the mode
    of the most restrictive currently granted lock. The lock manager processes the locks on the wait queue in FIFO
    order.
</pre>
</ul>
</pre>
</font>
</p>

<h3><a name="Interaction">Interaction</a></h3>
<p>
<font size="2">

The conversion can promote a lock from a less restrictive to a more restrictive mode, called an up-conversion,<br/>
or demote a lock from a more restrictive to a less restrictive mode, called a down-conversion.<br/>
<U>Only granted locks can be converted</U>. It is not possible to convert a lock already in the process of
converting or a request that is blocked on the wait queue.
Look at following scenario.
<pre>
        G_Q - L1-CR - L2-CR - L3-CR
[RES-A] C_Q
        B_Q

If L3 want to convert to CW, Lock manager can grant the request.
Because
<ul>
<li> CW is compatible with the most restrictive granted currently
<li> C_Q is empty
</ul>
        G_Q - L1-CR - L2-CR - L3-CW
[RES-A] C_Q
        B_Q

If L1 want to convert to EX, Lock manager will not grant this request,
because EX is not incompatible with CW. It will move the L1 to C_Q.
        G_Q - L2-CR - L3-CW
[RES-A] C_Q - L1-EX
        B_Q

If L2 want to convert to CW, Lock manager will not grant this requset,
because C_Q is not empty, it will be queued at the tail of C_Q.

        G_Q - L3-CW
[RES-A] C_Q - L1-EX - L2-CW 
        B_Q


The lock manager grants all down-conversion requests in-place; that is, the lock is converted to the new mode
without being moved to the convert queue, even if there are other lock requests on the convert queue. The lock
manager grants all down-conversions because they are compatible with the most restrictive locks on the grant queue
(the lock was already granted at a more restrictive mode)

        G_Q - L3-CW
[RES-A] C_Q - L1-EX - L2-CW 
        B_Q

If L3 want to convert to NL, it will be granted by Lock manager.
And then, L1 will be granted and moved to G_Q

        G_Q - L3-NL - L1-EX
[RES-A] C_Q - L2-CW 
        B_Q

</pre>

If you request a lock and the mode is incompatible with the most restrictive granted lock, your request is blocked.<br/>
It will be granted:<br/>
<pre>
The lock request becomes compatible with the mode of the most restrictive lock currently granted on the lock
resource, and there are no converting locks or blocked locks queued ahead of the lock request. The lock manager
processes the wait queue in FIFO order, after processing the convert queue. No blocked request can be unblocked
by the release of a granted lock, regardless of the compatibility of its mode, <U>until all blocked requests on the
convert queue and all blocked requests ahead of it on the wait queue have been granted</U>.
</pre>

<h3><a name="AST_BAST">AST/BAST</a></h3>
<p>
<font size="2">
<pre>
Unlike user-space clients, the DLM can directly execute callback routines when asynchronous lock requests are
satisfied (AST delivery), or in the case <U>a kernel-space client is holding that blocks another lock request (BAST
delivery)</U>.
When a kernel-space clientâ€™s lock request is satisfied, whether successfully (lock granted) or unsuccessfully (for
example, request timed out) the client will be notified via an AST.

<h3><a name="Cache_consistency">cache consistency</a></h3>
<p>
<font size="2">
OCFS2 caches file data and metadata in memory. Changes on one node are seen on other nodes in a
cluster. How to achieve this ?<br/>
<B>
In one word, take cluster inode lock will force other nodes drop cache
</B>
<br/>
The usage of the lock:
<pre>
ocfs2_readpage
  -> ocfs2_inode_lock_full //<font color="red">DLM_LOCK_PR</font>
  -> block_read_full_page
  -> ocfs2_inode_unlock    // ex == false

ocfs2_write_begin
  -> ocfs2_inode_lock //<font color="red">DLM_LOCK_EX</font>
ocfs2_write_end
  -> ocfs2_inode_unlock // ex == true

ocfs2_writepage
  -> no inode lock
</pre>

The most important point is ocfs2_inode_unlock will not drop the dlmlock.
<pre>
ocfs2_inode_unlock
  -> ocfs2_cluster_unlock
    -> __ocfs2_cluster_unlock
      -> ocfs2_dec_holders // only the DLM_LOCK_EX/DLM_LOCK_PR will be handled.
                           // this also indicates that only EX/PR is used in ocfs2
                           // <font color="red">Decrement
                           // lockres->l_ex_holders/l_ro_holders</font>
      -> ocfs2_downconvert_on_unlock
---
<font color="blue">
    // someone is waiting for our lock
    // refer to ocfs2_generic_handle_bast
</font>
    if (lockres->l_flags & OCFS2_LOCK_BLOCKED) {
        switch(lockres->l_blocking) {
        case DLM_LOCK_EX:
<font color="blue">
            // EX is not compatible with both EX and PR
</font>
            if (!lockres->l_ex_holders && !lockres->l_ro_holders)
                kick = 1;
            break;
        case DLM_LOCK_PR:
<font color="blue">
            // PR is not compatible with EX, but PR
</font>
            if (!lockres->l_ex_holders)
                kick = 1;
            break;
        default:
            BUG();
        }
    }

    if (kick)
        ocfs2_wake_downconvert_thread(osb);
---
</pre>
We could see that, the ocfs2_inode_unlock <U>doesn't unlock, but just update
holders.</U>
<pre>
Think of following scenario:

Node 0                       Node 1

write
lock inode with EX
                             read
                             try to lock inode with PR
                             blocked
BAST is triggered
</pre>
<br/>
Look at what does BAST do:
<pre>
o2cb_dlm_lock
---
    status = dlmlock(conn->cc_lockspace, o2dlm_mode, &lksb->lksb_o2dlm,
             o2dlm_flags, name, namelen,
             o2dlm_lock_ast_wrapper, lksb,
             o2dlm_blocking_ast_wrapper);
---

o2dlm_blocking_ast_wrapper
  -> lksb->lksb_conn->cc_proto->lp_blocking_ast(lksb, level);

ocfs2_blocking_ast
  -> ocfs2_generic_handle_bast
    -> lockres_or_flags(lockres, OCFS2_LOCK_BLOCKED) // if needs_downconvert
  -> ocfs2_schedule_blocked_lock
    -> lockres_or_flags(lockres, OCFS2_LOCK_QUEUED)
    -> list_add_tail(&lockres->l_blocked_list,
                  &osb->blocked_lock_list);
  -> ocfs2_wake_downconvert_thread
    -> wake up osb->dc_event

ocfs2_downconvert_thread
  -> ocfs2_downconvert_thread_do_work
    -> iterate osb->blocked_lock_list
       ocfs2_process_blocked_lock
         -> ocfs2_unblock_lock
           -> lockres->l_ops->downconvert_worker
              ocfs2_inode_inode_lops.downconvert_worker
              ocfs2_data_convert_worker

static int ocfs2_data_convert_worker(struct ocfs2_lock_res *lockres,
                     int blocking)
{
    ...
    inode = ocfs2_lock_res_inode(lockres);
    mapping = inode->i_mapping;

<font color="blue">
    /*
     * <U>We need this before the filemap_fdatawrite() so that it can

     * them up again.
     */
</font>
    unmap_mapping_range(mapping, 0, 0, 0);

    if (filemap_fdatawrite(mapping)) {
        mlog(ML_ERROR, "Could not sync inode %llu for downconvert!",
             (unsigned long long)OCFS2_I(inode)->ip_blkno);
    }
    sync_mapping_buffers(mapping);
    if (blocking == DLM_LOCK_EX) {
        truncate_inode_pages(mapping, 0);
    } else {
        /* We only need to wait on the I/O if we're not also
         * truncating pages because truncate_inode_pages waits
         * for us above. We don't truncate pages if we're
         * blocking anything < EXMODE because we want to keep

        filemap_fdatawait(mapping);
    }

    forget_all_cached_acls(inode);

out:
    return UNBLOCK_CONTINUE;
}

</pre>
So the cache is flushed here.<br/>
At the same time, ocfs2_unblock_lock will downconvert the lock if needed.

ocfs2_unblock_lock
