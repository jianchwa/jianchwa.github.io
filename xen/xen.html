<strong>Full virtualization</strong><br/>
<pre>
<ul>
<li>Disk and network devices
<li>Interrupts and timers
<li>Emulated platform: motherboard, device buses, BIOS
<li>“Legacy” boot: i.e., starting in 16-bit mode and bootstrapping up to 64-bit mode
Privileged instructions
<li>Pagetables (memory access)
</ul>
In the early days of x86 virtualization, all of this needed to be virtualized: disk and network devices needed to be emulated, as did
interrupts and timers, the motherboard and PCI buses, and so on. Guests needed to start in 16-bit mode and run a BIOS which loaded the
guest kernel, which (again) ran in 16-bit mode, then bootstrapped its way up to 32-bit mode, and possibly then to 64-bit mode. All 
privileged instructions executed by the guest kernel needed to be emulated somehow; and the pagetables needed to be emulated in 
software.　This mode - where all of the aspects the virtual machine must be functionally identical to real hardware - is what I will 
call fully virtualized mode.
</pre>
<strong>Xen and paravirtualization</strong><br/>
<pre>
A question of the original Xen research project at Cambridge University was, <strong>“What if instead of trying to fool the guest kernel into
thinking it’s running on real hardware, you just let the guest know that it was running in a virtual machine, and changed the interface
you provide to make it easier to implement?”</strong>. Then we got the paravirtualization.
In a paravirtualized VM, guests run with fully paravirtualized disk, network, interrupts and timers; there is no emulated motherboard or
device bus; guests boot directly into the kernel in the mode the kernel wishes to run in (32-bit or 64-bit), without needing to start 
in 16-bit mode or go through a BIOS; all privileged instructions are replaced with paravirtualized equivalents (hypercalls), and access
to the page tables was paravirtualized as well.
</pre>
<strong>Xen and full virtualization</strong><br/>
<pre>
HVM — which stands for “hardware virtual machine”.
Technically speaking, HVM refers to a set of extensions that make it much simpler to virtualize one component: the processor. To run a fully
virtualized guest, many other components still need to be virtualized. To accomplish this, the Xen project integrated qemu to emulate disk,
network, motherboard, and PCI devices; wrote the shadow code, to virtualize the pagetables; wrote emulated interrupt controllers in Xen; and
integrated ROMBIOS to provide a virtual BIOS to the guest.
</pre>

<strong>Problems with paravirtualization: AMD and x86-64</strong><br/>
<pre>
Most modern operating systems need just two levels of protection: user mode and kernel mode. Kernel mode memory is protected from user mode
memory via the pagetable “supervisor mode” bit.
When running a virtual machine, you need at least three levels of protection: user mode, guest kernel, and hypervisor. The hypervisor memory
needs to be protected from the guest kernel, and the guest kernel memory needs to be protected from the user. The pagetable protections only
provide two levels of protection, so Xen uses another processor feature, called a segmentation limit, to provide the third level of protection.
Segmentation limits are a processor feature that was in common use before paging was available. But since paging has been available,
segmentation limits have basically not been used;<strong> The pagetable protections protect both the guest kernel and Xen from userspace; the
segmentation limits protect Xen from the guest kernel.</strong>
Unfortunately, AMD desinged their 64-bit extensions to the x86 architecture. Since basically no operating systems use segmentation limits, AMD
decided to get rid of them. This may have greatly simplified the architecture for AMD, but it made it impossible for Xen to squeeze in 3 levels
of protection into the same address space. Instead, <strong>for 64-bit PV guests, both guest kernel and guest user-space need to run in ring 3,
each with their own address space. Every time a guest process needs to make a system call, it has to bounce up into Xen, which will context-
switch to the guest kernel</strong>. This not only takes more time for each system call, but requires flushing tlb per systemcall (a context
 switch is required here).
In 64-bit HVM mode, the problem doesn’t occur. The HVM extensions make it easy to have three different protection levels without needing to
play clever tricks with little-used processor features. So making system calls in 64-bit HVM mode is just as fast as on real hardware. For
this reason, a lot of people began running 64-bit Linux in fully virtualized mode.
</pre>
<strong>PVHVM mode to PVH mode</strong><br/>
<pre>
In fully virtualized mode, even with PV drivers, has a number of things that are unnecessarily inefficient. One example is the interrupt
controllers: fully virtualized mode provides the guest kernel with emulated interrupt controllers (APICs and IOAPICs). Each instruction that
interacts with the APIC requires a trip up into Xen and a software instruction decode; and each interrupt delivered requires several of these emulations.
PVHVM mode was introduced by Stefano Stabellini, the disk and network are paravirtualized, as are interrupts and timers, to minimize traps into the hypervisor.Privileged instructions are virtualized using the HVM extensions, and pagetables are fully virtualized, using either shadow
pagetables, or the hardware assisted paging (HAP) available on more recent AMD and Intel processors.But the guest still boots with an emulated
motherboard, PCI bus, and so on. It also goes through a legacy boot, starting with a BIOS and then booting into 16-bit mode.
PVHVM mode allows 64-bit guests to run at near native speed, taking advantage of both the hardware virtualization extensions and the
paravirtualized interfaces of Xen. But it still leaves something to be desired. For one, it still requires the overhead of an emulated BIOS and
legacy boot. Secondly, it requires the extra memory overhead of a qemu instance to emulate the motherboard and PCI devices. 

A lot of the choices Xen made when designing a PV interface were made before HVM extensions were available. Nearly all hardware now has HVM
extensions available, and nearly all also include hardware-assisted pagetable virtualization. What if we could run a fully PV guest — one that
had no emulated motherboard, BIOS, or anything like that — but used the HVM extensions to make the PV MMU unnecessary, as well as to speed up
system calls in 64-bit mode?
This is exactly what Mukesh’s PVH mode is. It’s a fully PV kernel mode, running with paravirtualized disk and network, paravirtualized
interrupts and timers, no emulated devices of any kind (and thus no qemu), no BIOS or legacy boot — but instead of requiring PV MMU, it uses
the HVM hardware extensions to virtualize the pagetables, as well as system calls and other privileged operations.
</pre>

<strong>What about KVM?</strong>
<pre>
Strictly speaking, KVM is just a set of kernel extensions designed to help processes implement virtualization. When most people speak of using
KVM, they mean “qemu-kvm”, which means qemu running configured to use the KVM extensions.
KVM supports both “legacy boot”, starting in 16-bit mode with a BIOS (or EFI) to load the kernel bootloader, and booting directly into a kernel
passed on the qemu command-line. It also provides an emulated motherboard, PCI bus, and so on. It can provide both emulated disk and network
cards; and thus it is capable of supporting guests running in fully virtualized mode.
KVM does not have a paravirtualized interface for timers or interrupts; instead (if I understand correctly) it uses an emulated local APIC.
Handling a full interrupt cycle for an emulated local APIC typically requires several MMIO accesses, each of which requires a context switch
and an instruction emulation. The Xen PV interrupt interface is based on memory shared with the hypervisor, supplemented by hypercalls when
necessary; so most operations can be done without context switches, and those that do require only a single context switch (and no instruction
emulation). KVM has paravirtualized devices and a paravirtualized clock, but not paravirtualized interrupts

This is very different from kvm.<br/>
<pre>
In kvm, after install the kvm module, the kernel itself become a VMM. The vcpu is a 
thread created by the qemu. The vcpu threads are scheduled as a regular threads in 
linux kernel.
</pre>


How to do the schedule ?<br/>

<pre>

schedule()
    -> sched->do_schedule() 
    // return a task_slice, .task is the next vcpu, .time is the time slice of the vcpu.
    -> set_timer(&sd->timer, now + next_slice.time)
    // This timer will raise SCHEDULE_SOFTIRQ, its handler is schedule().
    -> next = next_slice.task //task is a vcpu
    -> context_switch()
        -> __context_switch()
        // _important_ thing here is to change the guest_cpu_user_regs().
        // First, save the original one to prev->arch.user_regs, then restore the 
        // next->arch.user_regs. At the same time, the cr3 will be updated here
         // by write_ptbase(). The cr3 is used to save the page directory base.
        -> nextd->arch.ctxt_switch->tail(next);
            -> vmx_do_resume()
                -> load vmcs or some other
                -> reset_stack_and_jump(vmx_asm_do_vmentry)

#define reset_stack_and_jump(__fn)                                      \
    ({                                                                  \
        __asm__ __volatile__ (                                          \
            "mov %0,%%"__OP"sp;"                                        \
            CHECK_FOR_LIVEPATCH_WORK                                      \
             "jmp %c1"                                                  \
            : : "r" (guest_cpu_user_regs()), "i" (__fn) : "memory" );   \
        unreachable();                                                  \
    })

The pointer returned by guest_cpu_user_regs() is set to sp register.
Then jump to vmx_asm_do_vmentry()
