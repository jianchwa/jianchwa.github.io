What is distributed system ?
 - multipe cooperating computers
 - storage for big websites, MapReduce, peer-to-peer sharing,
 - lots of critical infrastructure is distributed.

Why distributed ?
 - to organize physically separate entities
 - to achieve security via isolation
                           ^^^^^^^^^
                               ?
 - to tolerate faul via replication
 - to scale up throughput via parallel cpu/mem/disk/net

but
 - complexity, too many concurrent parts
 - must cope with partial failures
 - tricky to realize performance potential


Around the whole distributed system, there are 3 kinds of abstraction,
 - storage -> disk
 - computation -> cpu
 - communication -> net

There are a couple of topcis come up here,
 - implementation
    - RPC, remote procedure call
    - threads (???)
    - concurrency control

 - performance
    - idea scene is that the performance is scaled out when number of nodes grow
      so handling more load only need to buy more computers
    - however, the fact is so perfect
       - the performance would not grow linearly with more nodes,
          - load imbalance
          - non-parallelizable code
          - bottlenecks from shared resources, e.g. network
    - we could also improve the performance through optimize the code


 - fault tolerance
   1000s of nodes, complex net -> node fault should be deemed a common thing.
   The failures should be hidden from the applications. (Not exact here,
   large amount of nodes failure would degrade the performance at least)


 - consistency
   consistency and performance are enemies
   strong consistency often needs more communication and more control
   high performance often impose weak consistency

MapReduce

   Scatter and Gather

   Input1 -> Map -> a,1 b,1 c,1
   Input2 -> Map ->     b,1
   Input3 -> Map -> a,1     c,1
                    |   |   |
                    |   |   -> Reduce -> c,2
                    |   -----> Reduce -> b,2
                    ---------> Reduce -> a,2

   Example: word count
    input is thousands of text files
    Map(k, v)
      split v into words
      for each word w
        emit(w, "1")
    Reduce(k, v)
      emit(len(v))

   When M and R are both >= N, Map()s and Reduce()s could run in parallel and
   balance well.

   Map() tasks needn't to talk with each other, as well as Reduce() tasks.
   But the Reduce() task need to talk with Map() task.

   The Map() task save its output files in local disk instead of the GFS
   which has a global namespace around the whole cluster, so the Reduce()
   task needs to get it through some special way, but essentially, through
   network. All of the network's throughput is limited, so it would be a
   bottleneck.

      .--------------------------------------.
     /                                        \
    +      input              output          +
    |   _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    _ _ _ _ _ _ _      |
    |  |_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|  |_|_|_|_|_|_|_|     | GFS namespace
    +         |                        ^      +
     \        |                        |      /
      '-------^------------------------^-----'
              |                        |
              | local replica          |
              v                        |
           Map worker                  |
              | local                  |
              v              net       |
        intermediate files   --->  Reduce worker

     - input files will be handed over to the node where one of
       the input files's replicas locates, thus no need to occupy
       network bandwidth for it
     - many more tasks than workers is good for load balance


   Fault tolerance

   There is a 'heartbeat' between the master and workers.
   If a worker no longer respond to pings, master deem it lost,
   and would recover the map or reduce works assigned to the worker.
