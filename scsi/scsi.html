There are two ways to get scmds completed:
<ul>
<li> LLDD complete the scmd by calling scsi_done
<li> block layer time the scmd out
</ul>
During this, the scmd->result will be set.
<pre>
scsi_cmnd->result
(((result) >> 1) & 0x7f)     status byte = set from target device
(((result) >> 8) & 0xff)     msg_byte    = return status from host adapter itself.
(((result) >> 16) & 0xff)    host_byte   = set by low-level driver to indicate status.
(((result) >> 24) & 0xff)    driver_byte = set by mid-level.
</pre>

scsi_decide_disposition will check them to decide what to do next.
<pre>
It will also check the sense data status byte is CHECK_CONDITION and sense data
is valid.
scsi_decide_disposition
--
case CHECK_CONDITION:
        rtn = scsi_check_sense(scmd);
        if (rtn == NEEDS_RETRY)
            goto maybe_retry;
        /* if rtn == FAILED, we have no sense information;
         * returning FAILED will wake the error handler thread
         * to collect the sense and redo the decide
         * disposition */
        return rtn;
--
</pre>
4 results will be returned by scsi_decide_disposition
<ul>
<li> SUCCESS, scsi_finish_command will be invoked next
<li> NEEDS_RETRY/ADD_TO_MLQUEUE, scmd will be requeued to blk queue
     During this, the scsi_device will be set blocked.
<pre>
__scsi_queue_insert
  -> scsi_set_blocked
  --
    case SCSI_MLQUEUE_DEVICE_BUSY:
    case SCSI_MLQUEUE_EH_RETRY:
        <font color="red">atomic_set(&device->device_blocked,
               device->max_device_blocked);</font>
  --
  -> blk_requeue_request
</pre>
<li> others, scmd will be delivered to EH.
</ul>

Next, scsi_finish_command will check the whether the scmd has been completed
correctly. <br/>
<pre>
scsi_finish_command
--
    good_bytes = scsi_bufflen(cmd);
    ..
    scsi_io_completion(cmd, good_bytes);
--

scsi_io_completion
--
    /*
     * special case: failed zero length commands always need to
     * drop down into the retry code. Otherwise, if we finished
     * all bytes in the request we are done now.
     */
    if (!(blk_rq_bytes(req) == 0 && error) &&
        !scsi_end_request(req, error, good_bytes, 0))
        return;
--
</pre>
It will check whether the scmd has been finished completely. <br/>
If not, further action will be done based on the scsi_cmnd->result and sense data.<br/>
<ul>
<li> We can call scsi_requeue_command().  The request
   will be unprepared and put back on the queue.  Then
   a new command will be created for it.  This should
   be used if we made forward progress, or if we want
   to switch from READ(10) to READ(6) for example.
   cmd->device->use_10_for_rw = 0;
                                                        
<li> We can call __scsi_queue_insert().  The request will
   be put back on the queue and retried using the same
   command as before, possibly after a delay.
                                                        
<li> We can call scsi_end_request() with -EIO to fail
   the remainder of the request.
</ul>

<h3><a name="EH">Error Handler</a></h2>
<p>
<font size="2">
The error handling procedure is done in scsi EH thread context. <br/>
Before the acutal procedure, it need to take over the host. <br/>
<strong>Take over scsi host</strong>
<ul>
<li> set SHOST_RECOVERY in shost->shost_state, then new scmds cannot enter LLDD
any more.
<pre>
scsi_queue_rq
  -> scsi_host_queue_ready
    -> scsi_host_in_recovery
    if yes, goto out_dec_target_busy
  -> scsi_mq_prep_fn // if !RQF_DONTPREP
  -> scsi_dispatch_command
</pre>
<li> wait for all in-flight scmds to be failed.
<font color="red">Note</font>: the 'failed' here indicates the scmds enters
into EH through scsi_eh_scmd_add, it could be either due to target's feedback,
or abort failed in time out path.
The EH kthread will be waked up only if shost->host_failed == shost->host_busy
shost->host_busy means the in-flight scmds around the scsi host.
<pre>
scsi_queue_rq
  -> scsi_host_queue_ready
--
    busy = atomic_inc_return(&shost->host_busy) - 1;
    ...
    if (shost->can_queue > 0 && busy >= shost->can_queue)
        goto starved;
--
</pre>
shost->host_failed means the scmds entering into EH through scsi_eh_scmd_add.


Even through we say "shost->host_busy == shost->host_failed", the LLDD cannot be 
really quiescent, <font color="red">the timeout path may not clean up the
scmds on the target, it may be still active there</font>, the irq commpletion could
occur at any time. Currently, we will try to abort the scmd firstly in the
timeout path, but it still may fail.
On the other hand, all such completions are ignored as the scmds have been marked
completed by the timeout path (<font color="red">scsi_times_out usually return BLK_EH_NOT_HANDLED</font>).
</ul>


<strong>How SCSI EH work</strong><br/>
Quote from the Documentation/scsi/scsi_eh.txt 
<pre>
If eh_strategy_handler() is not present, SCSI midlayer takes charge
of driving error handling.  EH's goals are two - make LLDD, host and
device forget about timed out scmds and make them ready for new
commands.  A scmd is said to be recovered if the scmd is forgotten by
lower layers and lower layers are ready to process or fail the scmd
again.

 To achieve these goals, EH performs recovery actions with increasing
severity.  Some actions are performed by issuing SCSI commands and
others are performed by invoking one of the following fine-grained
hostt EH callbacks.  Callbacks may be omitted and omitted ones are
considered to fail always.

int (* eh_abort_handler)(struct scsi_cmnd *);
int (* eh_device_reset_handler)(struct scsi_cmnd *);
int (* eh_bus_reset_handler)(struct scsi_cmnd *);
int (* eh_host_reset_handler)(struct scsi_cmnd *);

 Higher-severity actions are taken only when lower-severity actions
cannot recover some of failed scmds.  Also, note that failure of the
highest-severity action means EH failure and results in offlining of
all unrecovered devices.

Here, let's talk about a theme below:<br/>
When we issue a r/w command to scsi host adapter, we will do the dma map for the
sglist (usually stream mappings). When the command times out, can we complete
the command directly ? In the other words, can we unmap the DMA mappings
directly ?
<br/>
The answer should be <font color="red">NO</font>, given that the mappings are
stream ones, so they will be unmapped when the request is completed. And then
the <font color="red">DMA resource maybe used by other context.</font> If this
DMA resource is still active in the scsi host adapter, memory corruption will
come up. <br/>
How does the SCSI EH handle this ? Let's look into it<br/>
<pre>
enum blk_eh_timer_return scsi_times_out(struct request *req)
{
    struct scsi_cmnd *scmd = blk_mq_rq_to_pdu(req);
    enum blk_eh_timer_return rtn = BLK_EH_NOT_HANDLED;
    struct Scsi_Host *host = scmd->device->host;
...
    if (host->hostt->eh_timed_out)
        rtn = host->hostt->eh_timed_out(scmd);
    // <font color="blue">eh_timed_out is usually NULL</font>
    if (rtn == BLK_EH_NOT_HANDLED) {
    // <font color="blue">hand over scmd to abort_work</font>
        if (scsi_abort_command(scmd) != SUCCESS) {
            // <font color="blue">if abort_work has been scheduled, hand over to EH</font>
            set_host_byte(scmd, DID_TIME_OUT);
            scsi_eh_scmd_add(scmd);
        }
    }
    // <font color="red">BLK_EH_NOT_HANDLED will be always returned.</font>
    return rtn;
}
</pre>
timeout path will not complete the request. <br/>
Let's look at how does abort work handle it. <br/>
<pre>
void
scmd_eh_abort_handler(struct work_struct *work)
{
    ...
        rtn = scsi_try_to_abort_cmd(sdev->host->hostt, scmd);
        if (rtn == SUCCESS) {
            /*<font color="blue">If the scmd is aborted successfully,
              the DMA mapping is cleaned. Right now, we could finish/reissue it safely</font> */
            set_host_byte(scmd, DID_TIME_OUT);
            if (scsi_host_eh_past_deadline(sdev->host)) {
                ...
            } else if (!scsi_noretry_cmd(scmd) &&
                (++scmd->retries <= scmd->allowed)) {
                SCSI_LOG_ERROR_RECOVERY(3,
                    scmd_printk(KERN_WARNING, scmd,
                            "retry aborted command\n"));
                scsi_queue_insert(scmd, SCSI_MLQUEUE_EH_RETRY);
                return;
            } else {
                ...
                <font color="red">scsi_finish_command(scmd);</font >
                return;
            }
        }
        ...
    // If abort fails, hand over to EH
    scsi_eh_scmd_add(scmd);
}
</pre>

scmd_eh_abort_handler will not complete the request if abort fails, but hand
over it to SCSI EH. <br/>
<pre>
scsi_error_handler
  -> scsi_unjam_host
    -> scsi_eh_get_sense //<font color="red">will not work on the scmd with failed aborting </font>
    -> scsi_eh_ready_devs
void scsi_eh_ready_devs(struct Scsi_Host *shost,
            struct list_head *work_q,
            struct list_head *done_q)
{
    if (!scsi_eh_stu(shost, work_q, done_q))
        if (!scsi_eh_bus_device_reset(shost, work_q, done_q))
            if (!scsi_eh_target_reset(shost, work_q, done_q))
                if (!scsi_eh_bus_reset(shost, work_q, done_q))
                    if (!scsi_eh_host_reset(shost, work_q, done_q))
                        scsi_eh_offline_sdevs(work_q,
                                      done_q);
}

The scsi_eh_stu will also not work for scmd with failed aborted.
static int scsi_eh_stu(struct Scsi_Host *shost,
                  struct list_head *work_q,
                  struct list_head *done_q)
{
...
        stu_scmd = NULL;
        list_for_each_entry(scmd, work_q, eh_entry)
            if (scmd->device == sdev && SCSI_SENSE_VALID(scmd) &&
                scsi_check_sense(scmd) == FAILED ) {
                stu_scmd = scmd;
                break;
            }

        if (!stu_scmd)
            continue;
...
        if (!scsi_eh_try_stu(stu_scmd)) {
...
}
</pre>
SCSI EH will try bus_device_reset/target_reset/bus_reset/host_reset. <br/>
If succeeds, the DMA mapping must could be cleaned (the target will also be
operational), then we could finish the command or reissue safely. <br/>
If all of them fail, it indicates the target or host adapter is totally dead.
It should be ok to complete the request.

<pre>
void scsi_eh_flush_done_q(struct list_head *done_q)
{
    struct scsi_cmnd *scmd, *next;

    list_for_each_entry_safe(scmd, next, done_q, eh_entry) {
        list_del_init(&scmd->eh_entry);

                scmd->result |= (DRIVER_TIMEOUT << 24);
